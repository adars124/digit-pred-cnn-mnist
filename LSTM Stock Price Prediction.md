- Load the data
- Describe the data (Perform EDA)
- Preprocess the data (Handling duplicates, (outliers: optional), calculation of technical indicators and missing values)
- Data visualization (Stock Trend Visualization - Time Series Plot)
- Identify correlated features
- Data Normalization and Scaling (For this project, use min-max-scaler)
- Sequence Generation (specify lag value - backcandels)
- Split the dataset into train and test set (.80 of train and rest is test set)
- Model Architecture Creation (Build the LSTM model)
- Add early stopping mechanism to avoid overfitting (gradient explosion and vanishing problem)
- Predict values using the test data and developed model
- Evaluate the model using metrics like: root mean squared error, mean squared errors, absolute mean error, accuracy_score, and so on...
- Visualize the test and validation losses over time (if any spikes are observed, tweak the values)
- Export the model using `joblib` or `pickel`
- Deploy the model in a web app using either Flask or FastAPI.
- Demonstrate in the class
